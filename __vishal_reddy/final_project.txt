For my final project, I would like to create a basic prototype for a social media site that 1) is a community of people helping other people and 2) judges users (via rating/score) based on the things they do for other people/how helpful they are. 

  Target Audience:

-People who see themselves as "do-gooders"
-People who want other people to think of them as a resource for help
-People who want to find others to get help on a certain task, whether in-person or online


  Description of Functionality
  -Ability to create individual accounts
  -Ability to post requests/questions 
  -Ability to response to requests that other users have posted
  -Ability to view score that judges how helpful you are
  -Ability to search users by various tags (i.e. expertise, location, etc.)

  API(s) used (optional and may not be used if it turns out to be too complicated):
  -Quora
  -Yelp
  -Foursquare
  -Some other forum/Q&A-type site


I envision that users would receive a score based on how helpful readers find their posts on sites such as Quora, Yelp, etc, in addition to some sort of request system built-in to the site itself.  This means that users would have to be able to post requests/questions for other users to respond to.  I'm not sure if this would be outside the scope of what I will be able to accomplish by the end of the class, but it would be good to get some feedback to help me simplify the concept from a technical standpoint.
